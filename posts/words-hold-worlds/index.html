<h3 id="i-the-lie-of-meaning">I. The Lie of Meaning</h3>
<p>Language is a hallucination that pretends it isn&rsquo;t one.</p>
<p>Words don&rsquo;t mean, not really, they defer meaning. They triangulate it. A word is like a beam of light in fog - it suggests a direction, illuminates particles in its path, but what it ultimately reveals depends on where each observer stands. We all nod as if seeing the same thing, but we each perceive something subtly different.</p>
<p>Etymology makes this obvious. Trace a word and you&rsquo;ll find its origin was something completely different, words are false friends. Bait and switch.
&ldquo;Tall&rdquo; once meant &ldquo;quick&rdquo; or &ldquo;brave&rdquo; or &ldquo;handsome.&rdquo;<br>
Now it means &ldquo;can reach the top shelf.&rdquo;<br>
Somewhere between medieval chivalry and now, the word got stretched into something else.</p>
<p>As Derrida notes in <em>Of Grammatology</em> (1967): &ldquo;The sign represents the present in its absence. It takes the place of the present.&ldquo;¹</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="ii-philosophy-weeps-in-semantics">II. Philosophy Weeps in Semantics</h3>
<p>Derrida says this. His <em>différance</em> is the endless spacing and deferral of meaning. A semantic paradox. Language doesn&rsquo;t let you say the thing—it lets you say the thing <em>adjacent to the thing</em>. The center cannot hold because there is no center, only an infinite regression of signifiers pointing to other signifiers, never arriving at transcendental truth.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein confronted this too in his later work. What he once thought could be clarified through logical atomism, he later saw as &ldquo;language games&rdquo;—systems of meaning bound by context, use, and social agreement. The ladder he climbed, he then kicked away.</p>
<p>Deconstructionists and post-structuralists and post-modernists and post-post modernists dance around this wound. Barthes declares the death of the author because no one owns meaning; Foucault sees discourse as systems of power that speak through us rather than by us; Kristeva finds in poetic language the semiotic eruption of what symbolic language represses.</p>
<p>Every word is just a gesture toward a gesture. Meaning is a moving target, and we aim with bent arrows. Consciousness itself depends on a system that can never fully capture consciousness.</p>
<p><em>See: Derrida, Jacques. &ldquo;Structure, Sign and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences.&rdquo; Writing and Difference, Routledge, 1978, pp. 351-370.</em>

<h3 id="iii-case-studies-in-collapse">III. Case Studies in Collapse</h3>
<p>Take &ldquo;nice&rdquo;. Originally the word meant ignorant. Then wanton. Then showy. Then delicate. Now it means&hellip;. what? Pleasant? Empty? It&rsquo;s a white noise word. A word that&rsquo;s survived purely by shedding meaning and now saying &ldquo;nice&rdquo; is like saying nothing at all.</p>
<p>Or &ldquo;literally,&rdquo; which now means &ldquo;figuratively&rdquo; in a kind of collective gaslighting we all agreed to live with. We saw this meaning inversion happen in real time, it happened right in front of us and we stared as it transformed.</p>
<p>Or &ldquo;gay&rdquo;, a word that&rsquo;s changed meanings so fast it&rsquo;s almost in quantum superposition. Identity, slur, punchline, celebration. It means all this, depending on tone, age, platform. Every use is a referendum.</p>
<p>Words shift and they enscribe. They absorb culture like moss on stone. They exist in context. For example, I made up the word enscribe but it still made sense to you.</p>

<h3 id="iv-recursive-systems-fragile-selves">IV. Recursive Systems, Fragile Selves</h3>
<p>When you speak, you&rsquo;re not simply expressing thought—you&rsquo;re <strong>activating a vast semiotic network</strong>. You believe you&rsquo;re choosing a word.  But the word has already chosen you through histories you never consented to.</p>
<p>Try to define any word without using other words—can you? Try to mean something singular without summoning a constellation of adjacent meanings—no, it is impossible. Every sentence is a <strong>haunted house</strong>, occupied by ghosts of signification you never invited in.</p>
<p>As you read this sentence, observe how your neural architecture automatically assigns meaning without consulting your conscious mind. It&rsquo;s happening again with this very phrase, and again with this one. The recursion is inexorable.</p>
<p>Yet language isn&rsquo;t absolute chaos. Through this walk of slippages and referents, somehow, miraculously, we understand what we say.  The recursion loops, diverges, converges, but a signal ¹ persists through the noise.</p>
<p>This is our beautiful paradox: language fails at perfect communication yet succeeds despite itself. We speak from different islands of self, across waters of ambiguity, and still recognize each other on distant shores.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Language is not a neutral medium that passes freely and easily into the private property of the speaker&rsquo;s intentions; it is populated—overpopulated—with the intentions of others.&rdquo;<br>
—Mikhail Bakhtin, <em>Discourse in the Novel</em> (1934)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>FOOTNOTE:</strong>
¹ <strong>SIGN (n.)</strong><br>
Originally from Latin <em>signum</em>, meaning &ldquo;mark, token, indication.&rdquo;<br>
Now means: a word. Or a gesture. Or the thing a gesture refers to. Or the fact that you noticed the gesture.<br>
Sometimes used as a <em>sign</em> that you&rsquo;re noticing signs.<br>

<h3 id="v-the-embodied-word">V. The Embodied Word</h3>
<p>Language doesn&rsquo;t just live in our minds—it inhabits our bodies. When we say &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; we&rsquo;re using a metaphor that literally means &ldquo;to stand under.&rdquo; Cognitive linguists like Lakoff and Johnson show us that embodied metaphors structure abstract thought.</p>
<p>Notice how emotions have spatial dimensions (&ldquo;I&rsquo;m feeling down&rdquo;), how time becomes distance (&ldquo;the weekend is approaching&rdquo;), how arguments become battles (&ldquo;defending a position&rdquo;). These are stylistic choices that have become cognitive frameworks in our mind.</p>
<p>Even in digital spaces, language retains its physicality. We &ldquo;navigate&rdquo; websites, &ldquo;visit&rdquo; pages, &ldquo;scroll&rdquo; through text. The body&rsquo;s logic persists even as the medium changes.</p>
<p>This embodiment reveals another paradox: language simultaneously connects us to our physical reality and abstracts us from it. The word &ldquo;tree&rdquo; both evokes and replaces the living organism. Joyce referred to this phenomenon as &ldquo;commodus vicus&rdquo;—the simultaneous summoning and banishing of the actual—where language creates a parallel world that overlays the physical one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.&rdquo;<br>
—Ludwig Wittgenstein, <em>Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</em> (1921)</p>
