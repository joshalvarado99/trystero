      <description>&amp;ldquo;A man sets himself the task of portraying the world. Through the years he peoples a space with images of provinces, kingdoms, mountains, bays, ships, islands, fishes, rooms, instruments, stars, horses, and individuals. A short time before he dies, he discovers that the patient labyrinth of lines traces the lineaments of his own face.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;— Jorge Luis Borges</description>

      <description>Part I: Words Hold Worlds on etymology, recursion, and the deep weird of language&#xA;&amp;ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was a mistake.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;—Eliza Morgenstern, Linguistic Aporias (1978)&#xA;I. The Lie of Meaning Language is a hallucination that pretends it isn&amp;rsquo;t one.&#xA;Words don&amp;rsquo;t mean, not really, they defer meaning. They triangulate it. A word is like a beam of light in fog - it suggests a direction, illuminates particles in its path, but what it ultimately reveals depends on where each observer stands.</description>
