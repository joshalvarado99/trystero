<p>This writing draws primarily from postmodernist thought, with Thomas Pynchon serving as a central influence. At its core lies a fascination with systems of knowledge that subsume and overwhelm the individual. Language stands as the quintessential example of such a system.</p>
<p>While grounded in legitimate academic concepts from linguistics and philosophy, the text deliberately nudges these ideas toward the uncanny. It occupies the liminal space between scholarly discourse and ontological horror, using the formal conventions of academia not merely to inform but to unsettle.</p>
<p>This hybrid approach employs academic authority not as an end in itself, but as a vehicle to induce a specific cognitive effect, the subtle dread that emerges when we confront the possibility that our most intimate thoughts are predetermined by linguistic structures beyond our control.</p>

<p><em>on etymology and the deep weird of language</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was a mistake.&rdquo;<br>
—Eliza Morgenstern, <em>Linguistic Aporias</em> (1978).<br>
<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="i-the-lie-of-meaning">I. The Lie of Meaning</h3>
<p>Language is powerful. It builds worlds, undoes them, and loops meaning through cultural, historical, and neural circuitry. This is an anatomy of that power.</p>
<p>Etymology makes it obvious. Trace a word and you&rsquo;ll find its origin was something completely different. Consider &ldquo;tall.&rdquo; This word once meant &ldquo;swift&rdquo; or &ldquo;valiant&rdquo; in Old English. In the tales of medieval chivalry, a &ldquo;tall&rdquo; knight wasn&rsquo;t necessarily towering in stature. When Shakespeare described someone as &ldquo;tall,&rdquo; he often meant they were brave or capable.^[1]</p>
<p>Why did &ldquo;tall&rdquo; transform from a trait of character to a physical measurement? This shift reveals something about our cultural values. We hold an unconscious belief that physical height correlates with inner virtue. We didn&rsquo;t randomly select &ldquo;tall&rdquo; to mean &ldquo;of great height&rdquo;; the word evolved there because humans already associated lofty stature with noble qualities.</p>
<p>This seems so arbitrary. There is no advisory board of words that decided &ldquo;tall&rdquo; should change its meaning, no official proclamation or logical necessity. The meaning shifted because of countless small changes in usage, each one barely perceptible, until the cumulative effect was a complete reversal.</p>
<p>Derrida tries to explain why this drift happens. His <em>différance</em> is the endless spacing and deferral of meaning. Language doesn&rsquo;t let you say the thing—it lets you say the thing <em>adjacent to the thing</em>. The center cannot hold because there is no center, only an infinite regression of signifiers pointing to other signifiers. Words drift because of this endless pointing.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="ii-other-examples-of-word-drift">II. Other Examples of Word Drift</h3>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Rival&rdquo;</strong> derives from &ldquo;rivalis,&rdquo; meaning people who share a river, highlighting how resource competition and close proximity with neighbors bred conflict.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Literally&rdquo;</strong> - Once meant &ldquo;in a literal manner, exactly as described.&rdquo; Now it&rsquo;s often used for emphasis to mean its opposite: &ldquo;figuratively.&rdquo; We watched this meaning inversion happen right in front of us.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Nice&rdquo;</strong> began its journey from the Latin <em>nescius</em>, meaning &ldquo;ignorant&rdquo; or &ldquo;not knowing.&rdquo; When it entered English via Old French in the 13th century, it retained this sense of ignorance but quickly took on more explicitly negative shades: foolish, silly, stupid. Over centuries, the word underwent a transformation that linguists call <strong>amelioration</strong>, a gradual improvement in meaning. By the 15th century, it meant &ldquo;fussy&rdquo; or &ldquo;fastidious.&rdquo; In the 16th, it shifted toward &ldquo;precise&rdquo; or &ldquo;careful,&rdquo; and by the 17th century, it edged closer to &ldquo;agreeable&rdquo; or &ldquo;pleasant.&rdquo; Only in the 18th and 19th centuries did it settle into the sense we recognize today: kind, pleasant, agreeable. But in gaining so many meanings, <em>nice</em> has also become semantically diluted. It means <em>pleasant</em>, yes &hellip; but it&rsquo;s also a kind of semantic white noise, it means almost nothing. Imagine you ask someone to compliment you and the best they can do is &ldquo;you&rsquo;re nice&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Aside from revealing cultural quirks, word drift also exposes something more fundamental about power and control. The evolution of language is not random or neutral, it&rsquo;s the evolution of what a culture permits itself to say, believe, and reinforce. Words don&rsquo;t change because of some natural property of linguistic entropy; they change because of repetition, institutional reinforcement, and soft consensus about acceptable meanings. This brings us to Michel Foucault&rsquo;s thought: language is not just a passive reflection of culture, it is an active system of control.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="iii-surveillance-in-syntax">III. Surveillance in Syntax</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;There is no power that is exercised without a series of aims and objectives. But this does not mean that it results from the choice or decision of an individual subject; let us not look for the headquarters of power. It is not localized in the state apparatus, but instead circulates&hellip; It is exercised through a net-like organization. And not only do individuals circulate between its threads; they are always in the position of simultaneously undergoing and exercising this power.&rdquo;
— Michel Foucault, <em>Power/Knowledge: Selected Interviews and Other Writings</em> (1980)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Foucault invites us to imagine language not as a neutral tool that we wield, but as a vast architecture that contains and constrains us. In <em>The Archaeology of Knowledge</em>, he proposes that discourse—the way we speak and write about things—doesn&rsquo;t merely describe reality but actively constructs it. What appears as &ldquo;truth&rdquo; is  what the current discursive regime allows to be true.</p>
<p>For example: Grammar isn&rsquo;t neutral in structure, it&rsquo;s rooted in covert control. Consider how English sentences typically require a subject-verb-object pattern: &ldquo;John broke the window,&rdquo; not &ldquo;The window broke itself&rdquo; or &ldquo;Breaking happened to the window.&rdquo; This syntactic prison subtly enforces a worldview where active agents must always be identified and held responsible for change. Languages with different grammatical structures allow different perceptions of causality and responsibility. In Japanese, one can simply say &ldquo;窓が割れた&rdquo; (mado ga wareta) - &ldquo;the window broke&rdquo; - without assigning an agent, creating a more circumstantial understanding of events. English speakers are linguistically conditioned to see a world of intentional actors manipulating passive objects, while speakers of other languages may perceive a world of interconnected processes.</p>
<p>Language doesn&rsquo;t only describe power, it enforces it at the level of perception itself, determining what kinds of realities we&rsquo;re capable of conceiving. This linguistic determinism extends beyond syntax into the very fabric of sensory perception, influencing not just how we understand events but how we literally see the world around us.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="iv-language-bleeding-into-reality">IV. Language bleeding into reality</h3>
<p>The words available to you determine what you can perceive; even something as seemingly objective as color. The Himba people of Namibia have no distinct word for &ldquo;blue&rdquo; but five different words for shades of green. When tested, they struggle to identify a blue square among green ones, yet can instantly spot subtle green variations invisible to English speakers. Russian speakers, with separate words for light blue (&ldquo;goluboy&rdquo;) and dark blue (&ldquo;siniy&rdquo;), perceive these as fundamentally different colors; not shades of the same one. They can distinguish between these blues faster and more accurately than English speakers, for whom &ldquo;blue&rdquo; is blue.</p>
<p>These aren&rsquo;t just vocabulary differences; brain scans show actual perceptual variations. The color boundaries that seem so natural to you are arbitrary impositions of your particular linguistic infection.<sup id="fnref1:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>What chromatic realities remain invisible to you because your language hasn&rsquo;t named them? To press that thought further: what thoughts are impossible for you to think because your language has no pathway to them? What realities are invisible to you because your linguistic parasite didn&rsquo;t evolve the sensory apparatus to detect them?</p>

<p>The original quote appears in the now out-of-print second edition of Linguistic Aporias: Essays on Sign, Misfire, and the Failure of Language, published by the briefly operational Ironbell Press. Morgenstern, a semiotician turned conceptual artist, vanished from academia in 1982 after delivering a keynote entirely in glossolalia. Some scholars believe the quote is a misattribution from a Derridean parody she included as marginalia. Others argue it&rsquo;s the thesis of the entire book, footnoted back into itself.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a>&#160;<a href="#fnref1:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
